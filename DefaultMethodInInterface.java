/*
 *	In interface, we could only declare methods as opposed to abstract class till JAVA 1.7.
 *  
 *  But, since JAVA 1.8 we can define methods inside an interface. Thus, we do not have much difference between abstract class
 *  and Interface since JAVA 1.8. So, most of the times go for INTERFACES instead of ABSTRACT CLASS.  
 * 
 *  To define a method inside an interface you need to use keyword "default".
