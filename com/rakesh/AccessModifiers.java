/* In JAVA, we have "access modifiers" and not "access specifiers" as in C++;
 * You can not use private keyword with a class, unless it is inner class.
 * If you do not specify an "access modifer" for a class then it uses "dafault" access modifer.
 * The "default" access modifer will make class available inside the same package.
 * But class will not be available in other packages.
 * To make a class available for outside packages you need to declare it as public.
 * 
 *  Private - Visible within specific class.
 *  Default - Visible within specific package. If you do not specify any access modifier for a variable or method, this one is selected.
 *            This is also called as "Package Private".
 *  Public  - Visible in any class or package.
 *  Protected - Visible only in subsiding classes. 
 *
 *  A class can have final, abstract, public or default access specifiers only.
 *
